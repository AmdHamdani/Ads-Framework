# Ads Sample Project
This project is ready to use example for admob. One day I wanna try admob Ads but find no sample project and a simple usage of the Ads, so I decide to create a simple sample project that contains the basic functionality of Admob. This project use test Ad Unit ID from Admob, so you can build it without change the Ad Unit ID.

## Supported Ads Unit

* Banner Ads
* Interstitial Ads
* Rewarded Video Ads
* Native Ads

## Admob Test Ad Unit ID

I get the Ad Unit ID for test from [here](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/test-ads)

## Additional

I use [Mobile Console](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/mobile-console-108594) to inspect the log from the Ads, you can find it for free in Unity Asset Store. You can use this tools to inspect log from your code and game in runtime. I edit the code a few bit so I can show the button in the top right corner of the screen.
